# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

`exeris-spring-runtime` is an **independent Tier 1 product** in the Exeris ecosystem — a host-runtime integration layer, not a Spring Boot starter. The governing principle:

> Spring is the application framework. Exeris is the runtime owner.

Spring owns DI, config binding, bean lifecycle. Exeris owns transport ingress, request lifecycle, backpressure, off-heap memory, provider discovery (`ServiceLoader`), and the telemetry hot path. Any change that quietly inverts this ownership (servlet/Netty/Reactor on the request path, IoC replacing `ServiceLoader`, JDBC-first persistence) is an architectural defect, not a style issue.

**Who consumes this repo.** Exactly two consumers (see `~/exeris-systems/exeris-docs/high-level-architecture.md` §7 + §9):

1. **Customers with existing Spring applications** doing brownfield migration onto the Exeris kernel — the primary commercial path. This is the structural showcase that **Exeris is a runtime, not a framework**: it can host Spring code on top of the same kernel that powers the platform's kernel-direct SKUs.
2. **BudgetHQ** — the singular Spring-on-Exeris Family product (`~/exeris-systems/budgetHQ/`), deliberately structured to dogfood the Spring-on-Exeris combination as a shippable product under real customer load. All future Family products will be pure-Exeris on SDK + tooling; BudgetHQ's dogfooding role for Spring Runtime is filled once.

**Who does NOT consume this repo.** The Exeris platform itself does not depend on `exeris-spring-runtime`: the kernel, the Tier 2 capability ecosystem (`exeris-caps-*`), and all first-party Tier 3 Platform SKUs (Gateway-family AND Service Boundary-family — API Gateway, Edge Proxy, Bot Blocker, IDP, PIM, OMS, Headless CMS) run kernel-direct. Their HTTP surface is generated from `@ExerisDomain` + `@Action` via the codegen pipeline in `exeris-tooling` (ADR-015), never via Spring `@RestController`. No cap `@Requires` `exeris-spring-runtime` and no SKU manifest layers it in.

The kernel (`exeris-kernel-spi`, `exeris-kernel-core`) is consumed as binary dependencies and **must remain Spring-free**. This is "The Wall." The cap-tier Wall (per HLA §4) extends the same rule to every `exeris-caps-*` repository — no cap may reach into Spring internals, which keeps cap manifests reusable across both kernel-direct and Spring-Runtime-hosted deployments without manifest changes.

> **Cross-repo paths in this file.** References like `~/exeris-systems/exeris-docs/...` and `~/exeris-systems/budgetHQ/` are valid in a full multi-repo workspace checkout (see `~/exeris-systems/CLAUDE.md`). They will NOT resolve in the GitHub UI or in a single-repo CI log inspection — that is by design. This file is primarily for AI tool use with a multi-repo workspace; human reviewers reading on GitHub should treat such paths as siblings of this repo's parent directory, not as relative-to-this-repo paths.

## Build & test

Java **26 with `--enable-preview`** is required (kernel uses preview features → class file minor version 65535). Test JVM args are wired in the root POM (`-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseZGC --enable-preview`).

```bash
mvn -s .github/maven-settings.xml clean install        # full reactor build
mvn -s .github/maven-settings.xml -pl exeris-spring-runtime-web -am test    # one module + deps
mvn -s .github/maven-settings.xml -pl exeris-spring-runtime-web test \
    -Dtest=ExerisHttpDispatcherTest                    # single test class
mvn -s .github/maven-settings.xml -pl exeris-spring-runtime-web test \
    -Dtest=ExerisHttpDispatcherTest#methodName         # single test method
mvn -s .github/maven-settings.xml clean deploy         # publish to GitHub Packages
```

The `.github/maven-settings.xml` flag is required for snapshot resolution from GitHub Packages. Two env vars are read:
- `PACKAGES_READ_TOKEN` — used for the `github-exeris-kernel` server (cross-repo read of `maven.pkg.github.com/exeris-systems/exeris-kernel`). PAT (classic) with `read:packages` scope.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — used for the three `github-exeris-runtime-*` servers (this repo's own packages). Same PAT works for local dev — just `export PACKAGES_READ_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN`.

In CI, `GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by Actions and `PACKAGES_READ_TOKEN` must be configured as a repo secret (a PAT with `read:packages` scope). Deploy workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (snapshots auto on push to main, releases via `workflow_dispatch`).

## Module layout (and what belongs where)

| Module | Role | Hard rules |
|---|---|---|
| `exeris-spring-runtime-bom` / `-build-config` | Version + plugin config | No source. |
| `exeris-spring-boot-autoconfigure` | Boot wiring, properties, `SmartLifecycle`, `@Conditional*` | **Thin.** No transport, no request processing, no tx, no persistence. Classes >100 lines of logic are a smell. |
| `exeris-spring-runtime-web` | `HttpHandler` impl bridging Exeris `HttpExchange` ↔ Spring handler beans | Pure mode: no `jakarta.servlet.*`, no `io.projectreactor.*`, no body copy from `LoanedBuffer` to `byte[]` on primary path. May depend on `spring-web` model only — never `spring-webmvc`. |
| `exeris-spring-runtime-tx` | `PlatformTransactionManager` over `PersistenceConnection` | No `ThreadLocal` as tx context carrier; use `ScopedValue`. No `DataSource`/HikariCP ownership. |
| `exeris-spring-runtime-data` | Optional persistence bridge (high scrutiny) | Each public class needs an ADR/Phase-3 reference comment. No HikariCP, no JPA/Hibernate as a first-class path. |
| `exeris-spring-runtime-actuator` | Health, info, Micrometer bridge over `TelemetrySink` | Read-only / observability only. Never owns a data-plane path; never redefines `TelemetrySink`. |

Banned dependency edges: `autoconfigure → web/tx/data`, `web → data`, `data → web`, `tx → web`, `actuator → web (data-plane)`. Banned at the kernel boundary: any Spring type inside `eu.exeris.kernel.spi.*` or `eu.exeris.kernel.core.*`.

Banned from the runtime classpath in pure mode: `org.apache.tomcat.embed:*`, `org.eclipse.jetty:*`, `io.undertow:*`, `io.netty:*`, `io.projectreactor:*`, `jakarta.servlet:jakarta.servlet-api`, `com.zaxxer:HikariCP`. Each module ships a `PureModeClasspathGuardTest` that asserts these are absent.

## Pure Mode vs Compatibility Mode

Every meaningful change must declare its mode: `PURE_MODE`, `COMPATIBILITY_MODE`, or `MIXED`.

- **Pure Mode** (default): Exeris-native request path, no servlet/reactive runtime, performance-first. `ScopedValue` for context — `ThreadLocal` is banned on hot paths.
- **Compatibility Mode** (opt-in, activated by `exeris.runtime.web.mode=compatibility`): isolated in `*.compat.*` sub-packages, must carry a `@CompatibilityMode` marker, never activates automatically when pure mode is running. Narrow `ThreadLocal` bridging (e.g., for `SecurityContextHolder`) is allowed only here, must be cleared in `finally`, and must not leak into pure-mode paths.

Pure-mode code must not import from `*.compat.*`. Architecture tests (`*ArchitectureTest`, `*BoundaryTest`, `CompatibilityIsolationGuardTest`) enforce this — keep them green.

## Kernel SPI seams (where the bridge happens)

Read `docs/architecture/kernel-integration-seams.md` before touching any of these:

| Kernel SPI | Bridge class | Module |
|---|---|---|
| `HttpHandler` / `HttpExchange` | `ExerisHttpDispatcher`, `ExerisServerRequest/Response`, `ExerisRouteRegistry` (`@ExerisRoute` + `ExerisRequestHandler` beans) | `web` |
| `ConfigProvider` (registered via `META-INF/services`, priority 150) | `ExerisSpringConfigProvider` | `autoconfigure` |
| `SubsystemProvider` / bootstrap | `ExerisRuntimeLifecycle` (`SmartLifecycle`) — Spring refresh → kernel bootstrap → `HttpServerEngine.start()` | `autoconfigure` |
| `KernelProviders` (`ScopedValue` slots) | `ExerisContextHolder` | `web` |
| `TelemetrySink` → Micrometer | `ExerisActuatorTelemetryBridge` (`MeterBinder`) | `actuator` |
| `PersistenceEngine` / `ConnectionFactory` | `ExerisPlatformTransactionManager`, `ExerisDataSource` (compat-only JDBC adapter) | `tx` / `data` |

Bootstrap order is invariant: Spring `refresh()` → `ExerisRuntimeLifecycle.start()` → `KernelBootstrap.bootstrap()` (`ServiceLoader` discovers providers, DAG initialises, `KERNEL READY`) → handlers register → `HttpServerEngine` binds. Shutdown reverses exactly. The kernel's own bootstrap DAG (canonical, per `~/exeris-systems/exeris-kernel/docs/subsystems/bootstrap.md`) is `FOUNDATION: Memory (sequential) → SERVICES: Crypto & Persistence & Graph & Transport (parallel via StructuredTaskScope) → RUNTIME: Events & Flow & HTTP (parallel) → KERNEL READY`. `Config` is resolved by `KernelBootstrap` via `ServiceLoader<ConfigProvider>` before the orchestrator runs and is not a Subsystem in the DAG; `Exceptions` is not a Subsystem layer; `Security` is an L1 Citadel concept (ADR-012), not a boot-DAG node.

## Hot-path discipline

Code in `web` (and any tx/data adjacent to request flow) sits next to the kernel's hot path:

- No per-request wrapper DTO allocation in pure mode.
- No body copy from `LoanedBuffer` to `byte[]` / `InputStream` on the primary path — codecs operate on `MemorySegment` directly.
- `LoanedBuffer` ownership: handler must release or transfer; after `exchange.respond(response)` the engine owns the response body — caller must NOT release it.
- `HttpHandler.handle` must complete exactly once: respond OR throw `HttpException`, never both.
- Compatibility-mode allocation cost must be measured and documented, never silently applied to pure-mode paths.

## Documentation precedence

When docs disagree, the source-of-truth order is:
1. `docs/adr/*` — long-lived architectural intent
2. `docs/architecture/module-boundaries.md` and `kernel-integration-seams.md` — structural contracts
3. `docs/phases/phase-*.md` — current delivery scope
4. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — repo-wide review behaviour

Phase semantics: **Phase 0** bootstrap coexistence + Wall integrity; **Phase 1** Exeris-owned ingress; **Phase 2** opt-in Spring compatibility; **Phase 3** tx/context/persistence; **Phase 4A** events bridge (1.0 preview, default-off); **Phase 4B** flow/saga bridge (1.0 preview, default-off); **Phase 4C** graph integration (post-1.0); **Phase 5** edge gateway (`exeris-spring-runtime-gateway`, 1.0 preview, default-off; per ADR-021 — **not** an SCG compatibility bridge).

When changes affect ownership model, mode semantics, module contracts, or compatibility guarantees → **trigger an ADR**, don't just edit code.

### ADR status convention in this repo

Two `Status` patterns appear in `docs/adr/*`:

- **`Accepted`** / **`ACCEPTED (drafted and accepted YYYY-MM-DD; single decider — no future gating event; ratified by the PR that introduces this file)`** — the *accepted-on-merge* pattern. Use for ADRs with a **single decider, no future gating event, and a decision already made at draft time**. The PR review process refines wording; the decision itself is not subject to further deliberation. Merging the PR ratifies the already-made decision. Examples on main: ADR-010, ADR-017, ADR-021. ADR-027 (this PR) follows the same pattern; further ADRs in flight may too (the list is non-exhaustive — check `docs/adr/*` for current state).
- **`PROPOSED`** — the *deferred-decision* pattern. Use for ADRs where the **decision is not yet made** and the PR exists to gather input before a decider commits. The ADR sits in `PROPOSED` until a follow-up commit moves it to `ACCEPTED` (or `WITHDRAWN`). Used by ADR-011 (which has been `PROPOSED` since 2026-03-22 because the Pure/Compat mode taxonomy still has open follow-ups).

Picking between them is a function of *whether the decision is genuinely open*, not of *whether the PR is open*. An open PR for a single-decider ADR with the decision already made is `ACCEPTED`; an open PR for a multi-stakeholder ADR with the decision still being deliberated is `PROPOSED`.

If a PR review surfaces a substantive change to the decision (not just wording), withdraw the ADR or move it back to `PROPOSED` before re-submitting — do not silently amend the body of an `ACCEPTED` document.

## Testing expectations

Four layers, choose what the change requires:
1. **Unit** — adapter/wiring/codec/error-mapping logic.
2. **Module integration** — real Spring wiring with collaborators.
3. **Runtime integration** — end-to-end Exeris-hosted: context starts, kernel starts, ingress is Exeris's, Spring handler invoked, response returns through Exeris, shutdown is clean. (Wire-level socket E2E for Phase 1 ingress is still being built — see `docs/phases/phase-1-milestone-status.md`.)
4. **Architecture guards** — ArchUnit-style: `WallIntegrityTest`, `ModuleBoundaryTest`, `*ClasspathGuardTest`, `CompatibilityIsolationGuardTest`. These must stay green; failures here indicate a real architectural regression, not a test problem.

## Conventions to honour

- Package roots are strict: `eu.exeris.spring.boot.autoconfigure.*`, `eu.exeris.spring.runtime.{web,tx,data,actuator}.*`. Nothing under `eu.exeris.spring.*` may sit inside `eu.exeris.kernel.*`.
- Constructor injection over field injection. Immutable config objects. Explicit lifecycle sequencing.
- Don't promote convenience by hiding cost — if compatibility adds heap churn or ownership ambiguity, say so in the code/docs.
- Don't expand `autoconfigure` into runtime logic; don't dump cross-cutting helpers into one module.
